 
 CountDownLatch
 > A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until
   a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.
 
 
 CyclicBarrier
 >A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for
  each other to reach a common barrier point.  CyclicBarriers are
  useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that
  must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called
  <em>cyclic</em> because it can be re-used after the waiting threads
  are released.
  
- CountDownLatch不能reset，而CyclicBarrier是可以循环的；
- 工作线程之间互不关心  工作线程必须等到同一个点才去执行
